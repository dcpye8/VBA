The idea with this work was to start to develop and extract data from the comercial department.

Whith this in mind the code in this folder gets the data from an excel spreadsheet and creates two different outputs:

  - First it writes the data in a sheet for each person, where it's possible to see wich client they visited, date, etc, separated per month.
  - Second it creates 2 GANT diagram, one with the weeks and another with the days they were away. This is to get a visual idea of when they are in or out the company per year.
